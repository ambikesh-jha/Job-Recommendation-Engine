# Job-Recommendation-Engine
This project is a job recommendation system built with Flask, using Content-Based Filtering to provide job suggestions based on the content similarity of job titles and descriptions. By leveraging cosine similarity, the system identifies and ranks jobs that are most similar to the user's selected job title, displaying relevant job recommendations.
